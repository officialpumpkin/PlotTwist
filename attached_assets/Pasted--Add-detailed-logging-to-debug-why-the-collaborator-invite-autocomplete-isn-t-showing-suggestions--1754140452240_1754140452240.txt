// Add detailed logging to debug why the collaborator invite autocomplete isnâ€™t showing suggestions.

1. In client/src/components/UserAutocomplete.tsx:
   - In the input change handler, log:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE INPUT CHANGE:", value);
   - If there is debounce logic, instrument it to log:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE DEBOUNCED FIRE:", debouncedValue);
   - Before making the fetch, log:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE FETCH START:", `/api/users/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(value)}`, value);
   - If the code early-returns (e.g., input too short), add a log like:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE SKIPPED FETCH (too short or invalid):", value);
   - After receiving the response, log:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE FETCH RESPONSE STATUS:", response.status);
     Then parse and log the payload:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE FETCH RESPONSE DATA:", suggestionsArray);
   - After setting state for suggestions, log:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE SUGGESTIONS SET:", suggestionsArray.length, suggestionsArray);
   - In the render path where the dropdown visibility is decided, log:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE DROPDOWN RENDER:", { visible: shouldShowDropdown, suggestionsLength: suggestionsArray.length });

2. In server/routes.ts, in the user search endpoint handler (the one backing `/api/users/search`):
   - At the top, log the raw incoming query params and resolved search query:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE SEARCH REQUEST:", { rawQuery: req.query, resolvedQuery: (req.query.q || req.query.query) });
   - After performing filtering but before returning, log:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE SEARCH RESPONSE COUNT:", filteredUsers.length);
   - If no results or query is too short, log why:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE SEARCH EARLY RETURN:", reason, { resolvedQuery });

3. Ensure fetch errors on the frontend are caught and logged:
   - In the catch block of the fetch call, add:
       console.log("AUTOCOMPLETE FETCH ERROR:", error);

4. After adding these logs, test by:
   - Typing into the collaborator invite autocomplete input.  
   - Observing the sequence in the server console and browser console: input change, debounced fire, fetch start, fetch response, suggestions set, and dropdown render decisions.  
   - Copy the relevant log sequence for further diagnosis.
